CPU-only know Addition
RAM-Primary memory storage (Volatile)
Hardware-Secondary storage (Non-volatile)
Clock is a Heart beat of CPU

RAM-2 Types:
            S-RAM : FlipFlop(made of) Static
            D-RAM : Capacitors(made of) Dynamic

ARM:
            Cortex A : Application
            Cortex R : Real time Application
            Cortex M : Microcontroller(Process only)

Static RAM is faster than Dynamic Ram
BUS is used to communicate between CPU to Computer (Median)

Pheripherals:
            GPIO - To communicate environment
                 => These are sent by ‘System Bus’ (s bus)

AHB1=>180MHZ(Maximum)
It is two types:
            1. AHB/APB2-> 90MHZ(Maximum)
            2. AHB/APBI-> 45MHZ(Maximum)

GPIO
            1. Reading digital signals -> input
            2. Issuing Interupts
            3. Generating Triggers

    i. Genric Pin:Values consist of one or two voltage settings.(High or Low)
    ii. Behaviour can be programmed using software

Multiplexing- This pins used this method
Generic part- All the pins are connected to part

Output mode : Open drain stage 
Pull up resistor : Always use 0 or 1
Gate drain source(GDS)

Pull Push Configuration(Automatic)
Memory Maped : using memory to acess the I&O  
Making partion in memory with address
